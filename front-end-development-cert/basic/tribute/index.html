					<p><h5>Barney Kessel was a legendary jazz guitarist known for his rhythmic drive and his gentle personality. Like many of his generation, he grew up listening to Charlie Christian recordings, learning an economy of notes and an infectious sense of swing. Far from being a hinderence, growing up in Oklahoma meant that he got to play with any jazz talent passing though. Kessel was one of the founders of the bebop guitar school and went on to develop a sophisticated chordal vocabulary that was somehow both pianistic and guitaristic. He is remembered for countless jazz recordings, movie soundtracks, pop albums (as a member of the legendary "Wrecking Crew"), and instructional materials. To the general public he is probably best known as the guitarist on Julie London's sultry, hit recording of <i>Cry Me a River</i>.</h5></p>
